# About The Project

The application returns a list of the user's public repositories (limited to 100 records by GitHub API). The results might be then sorted by number of stars. 
The App does not require token authentication up to 60 API calls per hour. 

## Technology 

The App is built with ReactJS. It uses Axios and library to get a GitHub API call and React-Paginate for pagination. Styles are made with Sass.

## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and run npm install to install all the dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run npm start to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000
